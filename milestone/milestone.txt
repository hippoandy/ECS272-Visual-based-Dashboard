For this project, I selected to use the Pokemon datasets to provide a basic dashboard of it.
In the current progress, I created a bubble chart to present the different Pokemon Types.
The user is able to hover his/her mouse to see the exact amount, number of Pokemon that fit a specific type, shown on the tooltip.
The datasets have been pre-processing to compute the number of Pokemon that fit a certain Type and Egg Group.
The processed information is stored in two files:
1. "types.csv:: The Types of Pokemon with the amount and assigned display color.
2. "egggroups.csv": The Egg Groups of Pokemon with the amount and assigned display color.

The color is arbitrarily assigned based on the author's perspective.

When the project is complete, I would like to accomplish the following objectives:
1. Enable the user to click on a particular type of Pokemon and show all the Pokemon name on the chart.
2. Enable the user to further click on the Pokemon name to see detail information of the Pokemon chosen.
3. Use the other two different form of visualization to present different information of this dataset.
